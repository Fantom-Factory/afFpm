when to add pod dirs? Do we always add them? Or just work dirs? or just home dir?

-o  --offline
-d  --debug
-js --javascript

-t  --target pod / build.fan
-r  --repo

install / copy
pod may be a dir of pods
If the repo is remote, then don't query for dependencies / contact remotes
installs a single pod

update
resolves all dependencies


`fpm:default/afIoc/3.0` --> PodFile


fpm update build.fan [-r release]

fpm -o update -d build.fan [-r release] other args  <-- allow flags to be anywhere
need new cmd line parser
 
 
!! FPM F4 - cache the resolved pods - only re-resolve if the dependencies change !!
