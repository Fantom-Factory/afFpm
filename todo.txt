
config.mode = overwrite / addative

build build.fan
test pod
run pod
query pod+ver
delete

install

update  (pod / build.fan)

when to add pod dirs? Do we always add them? Or just work dirs? or just home dir?

-o  --offline
-d  --debug
-js --javascript

-t  --target pod / build.fan
-r  --repo

install / copy
pod may be a dir of pods
If the repo is remote, then don't query for dependencies / contact remotes
installs a single pod

update
resolves all dependencies


`fpm:default/afIoc/3.0` --> PodFile


fpm update build.fan [-r release]

fpm -o update -d build.fan [-r release] other args  <-- allow flags to be anywhere
need new cmd line parser


Explain How to:
 - update dependencies for a project
 - copy dependencies to a directory
 - install a directory of pods (say you have a new skyspark download, and you want to use all the new pods)
 - install dependencies for a fantom script
 - copy a pod from one repo to another / for move do a manual delete
 
!! FPM F4 - cache the resolved pods - only re-resolve if the dependencies change !!
