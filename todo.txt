For v2.1 :

Use some nice short names:

	PodVer
	PodInfo
	PodFile
	
Don't use heirarchy, use .toPodInfo() instead, otherwise you'll be tempted to downcast. I've determined that this is essentially caching, and re-using old info. Best to always get the latest.


MAKE ENV DYNAMIC - i.e. picks up new pods from lib dirs - then FPM can be used with SkySpark and allow new pods to be installed.


----

FPM - can not update dependencies for proj no in Eggbox - get 503
Bad username+password gives NoT JSON

FPM - when printing querys, does not sort versions proper: fpm query afDuvet
  release (file:/C:/Repositories-Fantom/repo-release/)
  - found afDuvet 1.1.10, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.1.6, 1.1.7, 1.1.8

FPM
	*  does not work: fpm install -r deimos afDomJax@0.0.8
	* does work:        fpm install -r deimos afDomJax
	* I maybe wrong - stoopid fish not updating the cur dir!



FPM - when printing config files, reverse the list so fall back is last

FPM - want to copy a pod to a dir + all it's dependencies (optional)

FPM - see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/dependency-resolution
score each possible dependency graph and attempt to resolve from highest down

FPM - maybe ability to resolve extra pods outside of build.fan?


FPM - use name/ver notation

FPM - often need to specify a source and dest repo
